# N-Body Simulation: Advanced GPU Implementation

## Overview
N-Body simulation calculates gravitational forces between N particles, representing one of the most computationally intensive problems in physics simulation. This implementation demonstrates:

- Advanced shared memory optimization techniques
- Hierarchical algorithms (Barnes-Hut tree)
- Memory bandwidth optimization
- Load balancing strategies
- Numerical integration schemes

## Mathematical Foundation

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
```
F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²
```

### Force Calculation for N Bodies
For each particle i, calculate force from all other particles j:
```
F_i = Σ(j≠i) G * m_i * m_j * (r_j - r_i) / |r_j - r_i|³
```

### Equations of Motion
```
a_i = F_i / m_i
v_i(t+dt) = v_i(t) + a_i * dt
r_i(t+dt) = r_i(t) + v_i(t+dt) * dt
```

## Computational Complexity

### Naive Approach: O(N²)
- Each particle interacts with every other particle
- Requires N² force calculations per timestep
- Becomes prohibitive for large N (N > 10⁶)

### Optimized Approaches:
1. **Shared Memory Tiling**: Reduce memory bandwidth
2. **Barnes-Hut Algorithm**: O(N log N) complexity
3. **Fast Multipole Method**: O(N) complexity

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Memory Bandwidth
- Each particle requires position, velocity, mass data
- High memory throughput requirements
- Need for data locality optimization

### 2. Load Balancing
- Irregular computation patterns
- Dynamic load distribution
- Thread divergence minimization

### 3. Numerical Stability
- Handling close encounters (singularities)
- Time step adaptation
- Energy conservation

### 4. Scalability
- Efficient scaling to millions of particles
- Multi-GPU implementation challenges

## Performance Optimizations

### Shared Memory Tiling
- Load particle data into shared memory
- Reduce global memory accesses by factor of tile size
- Improve memory bandwidth utilization

### Warp-Level Primitives
- Use shuffle operations for data sharing
- Reduce shared memory bank conflicts
