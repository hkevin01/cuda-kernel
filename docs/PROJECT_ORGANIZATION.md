# Project Organization Summary

## Project Structure After Cleanup

The project has been reorganized to maintain a clean and professional structure. All loose files from the project root have been moved to appropriate subfolders.

### Root Directory Structure

```

### Organized File Locations

#### Logs Directory (`logs/`)
All `.log` files have been moved here:
- `gui.log` - GUI runtime logs
- `gui_test.log` - GUI testing logs
- `test_*.log` - Individual kernel test logs

#### Scripts Directory (`scripts/`)
Scripts are organized by category:

**`scripts/build/`**
- `build_gui_hip.sh` - HIP GUI build script
- `build_hip.sh` - HIP kernels build script
- `build_kernels_safely.sh` - Safe kernel build script
- `fix_hip_builds.sh` - HIP build fixes

**`scripts/gui/`**
- `launch_gui.sh` - GUI launcher
- `launch_gui_clean.sh` - Clean GUI launcher
- `launch_working_gui.sh` - Working GUI launcher
- `run_gui_amd.sh` - AMD-specific GUI runner
- `setup_gui.sh` - GUI setup script

**`scripts/testing/`**
- `test_gui_*.sh` - GUI functionality tests
- `test_kernel_*.sh` - Kernel-specific tests
- `comprehensive_gui_test.sh` - Complete GUI test suite
- `quick_gui_test.sh` - Quick GUI validation

**`scripts/verification/`**
- `final_*.sh` - Final verification scripts
- `verify_*.sh` - Verification and validation scripts
- `fix_verification_final.sh` - Final fix verification

**`scripts/debugging/`**
- `debug_warp_primitives.sh` - Warp primitives debugging

#### Documentation Directory (`docs/`)
All status and summary documents:
- `GPU_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Overall project status
- `HIP_BUILD_SUCCESS_SUMMARY.md` - HIP build results
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - General project status
- `UNIFIED_BUILD_SUMMARY.md` - Unified build summary
- `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md` - This organization guide
- Various feature and fix documentation

### Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clean Root Directory**: Only essential files remain in the project root
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related files are grouped together by purpose
3. **Easy Navigation**: Developers can quickly find what they need
4. **Professional Structure**: Follows standard project organization practices
5. **Better Version Control**: Cleaner git status and diffs
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and understand the project

### Script Usage After Organization

All scripts maintain their functionality but are now in organized locations:

- **Build scripts**: `scripts/build/build_*.sh`
- **Test scripts**: `scripts/testing/test_*.sh`
- **GUI scripts**: `scripts/gui/launch_*.sh`
- **Verification**: `scripts/verification/verify_*.sh`

The main `run.sh` launcher remains in the project root for easy access.

### Updated .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to properly handle:
- All build directories
- Log files in the new locations
- Temporary organization files
- Script artifacts

This organization provides a solid foundation for continued development and maintenance of the GPU kernel project.
