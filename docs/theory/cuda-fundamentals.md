# CUDA Kernel Programming - Theoretical Background

## Introduction to CUDA Programming

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model. It enables developers to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. CUDA Programming Model

#### Thread Hierarchy
- **Thread**: The basic unit of execution
- **Warp**: 32 threads executed in SIMD fashion
- **Block**: Collection of threads that can cooperate
- **Grid**: Collection of blocks

#### Memory Hierarchy
- **Global Memory**: Large, high-latency, accessible by all threads
- **Shared Memory**: Fast, low-latency, shared within a block
- **Registers**: Fastest, private to each thread
- **Constant Memory**: Read-only, cached, optimized for broadcast
- **Texture Memory**: Read-only, cached, optimized for spatial locality

### 2. Parallel Algorithm Design

#### Data Parallelism
- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: Same operation on different data
- **Map Pattern**: Apply function to each element independently
- **Reduce Pattern**: Combine elements using associative operation

#### Task Parallelism
- **Fork-Join**: Split work into parallel tasks, then combine results
- **Pipeline**: Data flows through stages of processing

## Algorithm Analysis

### 1. Vector Addition
**Complexity**: O(n) - Linear in number of elements
**Memory Pattern**: Streaming (sequential access)
**Optimization Strategy**: Memory coalescing, grid-stride loops

```
Theoretical Peak Performance:
- Memory-bound operation
- 3 memory operations per element (2 reads, 1 write)
- Limited by memory bandwidth, not compute power
```

### 2. Matrix Multiplication
**Complexity**: O(n³) - Cubic in matrix dimension
**Memory Pattern**: Complex (A row-wise, B column-wise, C accumulation)
**Optimization Strategy**: Tiling, shared memory, register blocking

```
Theoretical Analysis:
- Arithmetic Intensity: 2n³ operations / 3n² memory = 2n/3 ops/byte
- For large n, becomes compute-bound
- Optimization focuses on memory hierarchy utilization
```

### 3. Parallel Reduction
**Complexity**: O(log n) - Logarithmic steps, O(n) work
**Memory Pattern**: Tree-structured communication
**Optimization Strategy**: Warp primitives, avoiding bank conflicts

```
Reduction Tree Analysis:
- Step 1: n/2 operations
- Step 2: n/4 operations
- ...
- Step k: n/2^k operations
- Total: n(1 - 1/n) ≈ n operations in log(n) steps
```

### 4. 2D Convolution
**Complexity**: O(n²m²) - Quadratic in image size and filter size
**Memory Pattern**: Structured with overlap and reuse
**Optimization Strategy**: Shared memory tiling, constant memory for filters

```
Convolution Analysis:
- Sliding window operation
- High data reuse potential
- Memory access pattern depends on filter size
- Boundary handling affects performance
```

### 5. Monte Carlo Simulation
**Complexity**: O(n) - Linear in number of samples
**Memory Pattern**: Random access, minimal data reuse
**Optimization Strategy**: High-quality random number generation, reduction

```
Monte Carlo Properties:
- Embarrassingly parallel
- Convergence rate: O(1/√n)
- Quality depends on random number generator
- Results aggregation requires reduction
```

## Performance Modeling

### Roofline Model
The roofline model helps understand performance limits:

```
Performance = min(Peak_Compute, Peak_Memory_Bandwidth × Arithmetic_Intensity)
```

Where:
- **Arithmetic Intensity** = Operations / Bytes transferred
- **Peak Compute** = Maximum FLOPS capability
- **Peak Memory Bandwidth** = Maximum memory throughput

### Memory Coalescing
For optimal memory performance:
- Access consecutive memory locations in a warp
- Align memory accesses to 32, 64, or 128-byte boundaries
- Avoid stride patterns that cause cache misses

### Occupancy Optimization
Occupancy = (Active Warps) / (Maximum Possible Warps)

Factors affecting occupancy:
- Register usage per thread
- Shared memory usage per block
- Block size configuration
- Compute capability limits

## Mathematical Foundations

### Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan)
Used in reduction and other algorithms:
```
Input:  [a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅, a₆, a₇, a₈]
Output: [a₁, a₁⊕a₂, a₁⊕a₂⊕a₃, ..., a₁⊕a₂⊕...⊕a₈]
```

### Matrix Multiplication Optimization
**Cache-Oblivious Algorithm**: Recursively divide matrices
**Tiling Strategy**: Balance shared memory usage and reuse
**Register Blocking**: Each thread computes multiple output elements

### Random Number Generation
**Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)**:
```
Xₙ₊₁ = (aXₙ + c) mod m
```

**Mersenne Twister**: Higher quality but more complex
**cuRAND**: NVIDIA's optimized random number library
