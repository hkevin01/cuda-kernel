## 🐛 **Current Issues**

### High Priority 🔴
1. **Warp Primitives Advanced Version**
   - HIP cooperative groups API differences vs CUDA
   - Need to rewrite using HIP-native primitives
   - Current simplified version works

2. **Missing Main Applications**
   - Advanced FFT and N-Body have kernels but no test harnesses
   - Need `main_hip.cpp` files for both

### Medium Priority 🟡
3. **GUI Application Build Failure**
   - Missing `cuda_common` library dependency
   - Qt6 available but linking issues
   - Need to adapt for HIP-only build

4. **Build System Inconsistency**  
   - CMakeLists.txt configured for CUDA primarily
   - HIP build script (`scripts/build_hip.sh`) incomplete
   - Need unified build system

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps**

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)
1. **Complete Advanced Examples**
   ```bash
   # Create main applications for:
   - src/10_advanced_fft/main_hip.cpp
   - src/11_nbody_simulation/main_hip.cpp
   ```

2. **Fix Warp Primitives Advanced Version**
   - Replace CUDA cooperative groups with HIP equivalents
   - Use `__shfl_*`, `__ballot_sync`, etc. directly

3. **Build All Advanced Examples**
   ```bash
   # Build missing examples:
   - 07_advanced_threading_hip
   - 08_dynamic_memory_hip
   - 10_advanced_fft_hip
   - 11_nbody_simulation_hip
   ```

### Secondary Actions
4. **Fix GUI Application**
   - Resolve cuda_common dependency
   - Create HIP-compatible common library

5. **Implement Multi-GPU Ray Tracing**
   - Design and implement the missing advanced example
