echo "1. 3D FFT KERNEL - FIXED ‚úÖ"
echo "   Problem: 'Could not find executable for kernel 3D FFT'"
echo "   Root Cause: Missing from simplified argument list"
echo "   Solution: Added 'kernelName == \"3D FFT\"' to simplified argument check (line 333)"
echo "   Mapping: 3D FFT ‚Üí advanced_fft executable"
echo "   Status: ‚úÖ WORKING"

echo "2. WARP PRIMITIVES KERNEL - FIXED ‚úÖ"
echo "   Problem: 'Could not find executable for kernel Warp Primitives'"
echo "   Root Cause: Included in simplified args but no executable"
echo "   Solution: Removed from simplified argument list (commented out line 332)"
echo "   Status: ‚úÖ PROPERLY DISABLED (shows 'Not Built')"

echo "3. QT6 COMPATIBILITY - FIXED ‚úÖ"
echo "   Problem: setColor method not found in QTextCharFormat"
echo "   Solution: Changed setColor ‚Üí setForeground in syntax highlighter"
echo "   Status: ‚úÖ COMPILES AND WORKS"
