        <title>N-Body Simulation üåå‚≠ê - Simulating the Universe's Gravitational Dance</title>
        <overview>
            This example demonstrates N-body gravitational simulation - modeling the complex interactions 
            between thousands of celestial bodies like stars, planets, and galaxies. Like watching the 
            cosmic ballet where every particle influences every other through gravitational forces, 
            this simulation showcases GPU's incredible power for physics modeling, revealing how 
            thousands of objects can interact simultaneously in real-time.
        </overview>
        <analogy>
            <strong>Think of it like this:</strong> Imagine a cosmic dance floor with thousands of dancers, 
            where each dancer is attracted to every other dancer with a force that depends on their 
            masses and distances. As they move, the gravitational forces constantly change, creating 
            complex orbital patterns, collisions, and emergent behaviors. With GPU acceleration, 
            we can simulate this intricate dance with astronomical numbers of particles in real-time.

        <importance>
            <why>
                N-body simulation is the foundation of computational physics and astronomy. It's how we 
                understand galaxy formation, design space missions, and study everything from planetary 
                rings to dark matter. The same techniques apply to molecular dynamics, materials science, 
                and any system where many objects interact through forces. GPU acceleration has revolutionized 
                our ability to simulate complex systems that were previously impossible to model.
            </why>
            <performance>
                Modern GPU N-body simulations can handle millions of particles in real-time, enabling 
                interactive exploration of cosmic phenomena and real-time physics in games and simulations. 
                What once required supercomputers now runs on desktop GPUs, democratizing access to 
                sophisticated physics modeling and enabling new discoveries in science and engineering.
